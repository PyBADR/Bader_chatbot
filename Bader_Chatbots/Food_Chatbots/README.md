### Training the RASA 

In order to train the interpreter, run the following command

```sh
$ python -m rasa_nlu.train -c nlu_config.yml --data data/data.json -o models --fixed_model_name nlu --project current --verbose
```

In order to train RASA CORE, run the following command

```sh
$ python -m rasa_core.train -d domain.yml -s data/stories.md -o models/current/dialogue -c policies.yml
```

### Running the RASA on commandline

In order to run rasa action server, execute
```sh
$ python -m rasa_core_sdk.endpoint --actions actions
```


In order to run rasa at commandline, execute
```sh
$ python -m rasa_core.run -d models/current/dialogue -u models/current/nlu --endpoints endpoints.yml
```

### Running the RASA on GUI
First, run a small flask server to get the GUI
```sh
$ cd chat_interface
$ python deploy.py
```
This will run flask server with a chat window that can be accessed by visiting
http://localhost:5090

Next get the rasa action server up and running
```sh
$ python -m rasa_core_sdk.endpoint --actions actions
```

Next run rasa as a simple server
```sh
$ python -m rasa_core.run --enable_api -d models/current/dialogue -u models/current/nlu -o out.log --endpoints endpoints.yml
```

Now if you go to your browser and open http://localhost:5090, a chat window will pop up and you can converse with the bot.
